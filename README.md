Text-To-Speech module that allows the interpretation of text inputs from different sources using the Pytesseract and the Google Text-To-Speech libraries.

# Features

The objective of this project is to extract the text contained in images or files in .pdf format and convert the text into speech. 

To do this, it is necessary to use the Pytesseract library, which allows to proceed with this text interpretation and Google Text-To-Speech, which facilitates the final conversion of the text extracted with the previous library into the spoken text referred to above.

It includes the functionality of being able to capture through the webcam an image with text and interpret the displayed text.
